# Ocean World Generative World  
Made for the Low Effort Game Jam 8: [https://itch.io/jam/low-effort-jam-8](https://itch.io/jam/low-effort-jam-8)  
  
## Controls  
Fly Plane - WASD
  
## Other info  
Theme was water. I decided on something open world, and I thought that doing something relating to terrain generation and perlin noise would be fun.  
  
Tested and works on Chrome for Windows. Not tested anywhere else. Not mobile compatible  
Performance is not great - this is known. I also don't care.  
  
Built using my own game engine for HTML5/Canvas  
  
## It's not polished  
I am aware. This is infact the point of the jam. It is a low effort game, and while adding jsdoc to the engine was rather high-effort, once completed I left my single braincell in my pocket to finish the game.  
  
## Is there an itch.io link?  
Maybe. I don't have one right now because I haven't submitted as I type this. If I can be bothered, it'll be here: \[not here yet\]  
  
## Licence?  
Cheers to @josephg, for the implementation of the perlin noise generator [https://github.com/josephg/noisejs](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs)
